Little longer and he'll race against his kid
Team fucked up
Strategy once again and now they'll have to rethink
Kimi no, you will not have the drink

Some things he needs for real
Gloves and the steering wheel

* Kimi, Kimi, Kimi, Iceman on the race track
* He's the king of Spa and winner in Silverstone
* Kimi, Kimi, Kimi, Iceman on the race track
* He knows what to do so we'll just leave him alone

In Hungaroring, Monza or in Hockenheim
Doesn't matter Kimi parties all the time

Some things he needs for real
Gloves and the steering wheel
